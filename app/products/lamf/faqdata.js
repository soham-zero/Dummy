  "Basics of LAMF": [
    {
      question: "What is Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF)?",
      answer:
        "LAMF is a secured loan where you pledge your mutual fund units as collateral to borrow money without selling your investments."
    },
    {
      question: "How is LAMF different from other loans like LAS or term loans?",
      answer:
        "LAMF uses mutual fund units as collateral, while LAS uses shares or other securities. Most LAMF loans are offered as overdrafts with flexible draws and interest only on the amount used."

    {
      question: "Who can apply for LAMF?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can I pledge SIP units or ELSS funds?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can joint holdings be pledged?",
      answer:

    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: "Are there charges for lien marking or removal?",
      answer:
        "Some providers may charge fees for pledge, confirmation, invocation, or de-pledge processes; fees vary by lender."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the value of my mutual funds drops?",
      answer:
        "If the fund value falls below required levels, you may receive a margin call asking you to pledge more units or repay part of the loan."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do I get to regularize a margin call?",
      answer:
        "This varies by lender but is usually between 4 to 7 working days."

  ],
  "Risks, Taxation & Usage": [
    {
      question: "Is the loan amount taxable?",
      answer:
        "No, loan proceeds are not considered taxable income. However, if the lender sells pledged units due to default, capital gains tax may apply."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there restrictions on how I can use the loan proceeds?",
      answer:
        "Generally, there are no restrictions on loan use, except it cannot be used for speculative capital market activities per lender policy."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I borrow to reinvest in the same mutual fund?",
      answer:
        "This is risky due to market volatility, interest costs, and potential margin calls. Diversified investment strategies are usually safer."
    }
  ],
